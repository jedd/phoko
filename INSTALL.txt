Phoko - Installation Guide

PROJECT PAGE:  http://dingogully.com.au/trac/phoko


Grab the software.

Best way is using git, as described on the project
web site.  Go into your web root, and then run:

$  git clone git://dingogully.com.au/phoko

You can later update with 'git pull', of course.



Set up the cache sub-directories.

We need some world (or at least apache-user) writable
directories - at the moment the former is easier, so:

$  cd phoko
$  ./mkcachedir.sh



Fix up .htaccess

I apologies for this - it's a bizarre CodeIgniter-ism that
I haven't worked out yet.  The .htaccess has, on the last
line, the path that I use.  We need a .htaccess to get rid
of CI's 'index.php' that would otherwise appear in every URL.

You just need to edit that last line in the .htaccess file

It's currently set to:
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /~jedd/phoko/index.php/$1 [L]

If you are not using a ~/user/ directory under Apache,
then this line usuall works just fine - so try this first:
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ./index.php/$1 [L]



Configure the configuration file

Pretty much all the useful configuration stuff is done in
   phoko/app/config/phoko.php

It is *heavily* documented inline, so just work through it
and change the things it says desperately need changing,
and try not to change the things that it says will likely
break if you sneeze near them.

The really important things are:
  repository - where it can find your KPA index.xml basically
  publish_keyword - the magic tag that will publish an image
  category_abbreviations - IFF you have custom categories
  shoosh_tags - if you want to hide any tags



And that should be it at this end.


Go into KPhotoAlbum and tag a few images with your nominated
tag ($publish_keyword, as defined in config/phoko.php) and
then browse to your URL, and wait for the server to thumbnail
the first 7 images, and generate a medium-sized version of
your first image.

if you have any problems or suggestions on ways of improving
this documentation or the application.
