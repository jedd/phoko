<h1>Preamble</h1>
<b>Licence</b> - this software is released under the GPL-2 licence (see accompanying file).
<br>
<b>Author</b> - It was written, using Quanta, on Debian, for an Apache/PHP/ImageMagick
system, by Jedd around 2008-11.


<h1>Installation</h1>

Dump the tarball contents to a directory within your web server - this can be
under your home or personal directory (~/public_html usually) or in the main
directory (/var/www on a Real Computer).

<p>
The cache sub-directory needs to be writable by whatever user the web daemon runs.
</p>

<p>
Modify the config.php file  - this is fairly self-documented, but in detail:
</p>

<p>
<br><b>picturerepository</b> - the path to where your index.xml file is.  You may
want to make a sub-directory within the kphpalbum, call it something hard to guess,
such as f05484902348fjjadlkfj (don't use this - make up your own), and have that as
a symlink to your picture repository root.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>xmlfile</b> - don't touch this unless you really know what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>thumbsperpage</b> - try it on a display and work out what you're happy with.
A setting of 8 (default) works excellently on a 1024x600 display, but will likely
look crap on a 22" monitor at 1680.  One day the author will work out a way of doing
this a bit more intelligently.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>PUBLISHKEYWORD</b> - enter here the tag you will use for the KEYWORD category
to denote that the picture should be published.  At the moment it MUST be a keyword,
not a locations or persons or other categories.  This may change one day ... but for
now, just cope.  Note, if you're going to have multiple people sharing out of the
same kphotoalbum repository, or you may have multiple galleries aimed at different
audiences, say, then use something sensible with your tags.  For instance "PUBLISH - bob"
and on another web instance you could have "PUBLISH - carol"
</p>

<p>
<br><b>SHOOSHTAGS</b> - a set of arrays showing tags that you never want the world
to see.  In the example you'll see 'OK - jedd', which is the tag I use to denote
that I have completed all tagging of that image.  You may have other tags that
are irrelevant to the rest of the world, or just too rude, that you can put in here.
<br />
<b>Note</b> - you <b>MUST</b> add in any custom categories you're using to the
array here, even if you leave that sub-array empty, otherwise you'll get errors.
</p>

<p>
<br><b>imagesizes</b> - again, an array of sizes that is fairly straightforward.  Note
that the sizes are mostly irrelevant, insofar as images are displayed to fit a percentage
of the screen (large) or blown to full-screen (huge) via &lt;img&gt; tags within the code.
What these sizes REALLY determine is the physical size of the file, indirectly.  The imagemagick
command line tools allow you to specify -quality settings, which is more what we're after,
however at the moment we shrink the original based purely on height/width.  In other words,
this is a compromise, and it may one day change.
</p>


<p>
<br><b>panorama settings</b> - This is fairly straightforward - the first turns panorama
options on or off.  If enabled here, the code elsewhere will offer a Panorama view in the
three sizes defined in the config file, whenever an image with a ratio of width : height
exceeding 2 is detected.
<br />
The three settings here can be modified to best suit various monitors, and in fact you
should be able to make an array of more than 3 items if you want.  (This was developed
on an MSI Wind, so testing of larger device settings is a tad tricky).
<br />
<b><i>Note</i></b> - we use the excellent <b>ptviewer</b> software, which is released
under the GNU GPL.  Consequently we are allowed to redistribute just the one viewer
component of this package, but please see the
<a href="http://www.fsoft.it/panorama/ptviewer.htm">author's home page</a> for more
information about this quite superb applet.
</p>

<br />

<h1>Usage</h1>
We assume you're using kphotoalbum with the following settings:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp; index.xml file (rather than database)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp; visibility of your picture repository from your web server (yes, potentially dangerous)

<p>

If the above conditions are satisfied, then it's a simple matter of
tagging the pictures you want to publish with the tag set above in
the config.php file, and then saving the configuration of kphotoalbum.

<p>

Subsequent hits via the web page will then automatically show the
pictures thus tagged.





<h1>Maintenance</h1>
<h2>Images</h2>

<p>
If you change the sizes (via the config file) then the old files are automatically overwritten.
</p>

However, if you remove the publish-tag from a picture, then the old thumbnail/huge/large files
will be retained in the cache until you clean them out.  This can be done via the 'Admin'
function (to the right of the Filters).  This is a fairly safe method - it merely fiddles
with the cache files, so shouldn't present any security issues.

<h1>To Do List</h1>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp; User configurable 'number of thumbnails to show' - perhaps using cookies?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp; User configurable sizes of thumbs and large - just using 'width' settings (not actually modifying the cached files, of course).
