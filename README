1. Overview

	Phoko is a PHP / web application that is useful if (and only if)
	you currently use KPhotoAlbum to manage your photo collection, and
	want an easy way of publishing some of your photos to the web.

	To be crystal clear - if you don't use KPhotoAlbum, this isn't
	of any use to you at all.  Seriously.  None.
